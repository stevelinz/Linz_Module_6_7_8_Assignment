 Title: Hungry At Home (HAH) - COVID Dinning [based on a true story]

 In this covid age we don't go out much if at all. So when we are
 hungry we are Hungry At Home. Finding food will mean foraging through
 out the premises. So where to look? Some places don't make sense
 and won't be included like bathrooms, shed, garage, utility rooms etc.

 WHERE TO SEARCH:

 Porch  Cellar  Kitchen  TvRoom  BedRoom  Office  Garden

 Once you pass the training process there are food assets available:

 Farm Assets = beans, mint, tomatoes, squash, kale, lettuce, eggplant.
 Grocery Assets = Hamburger, cheese, potatoes, popcorn, yogurt, etc.

 Not only are you Hungry At Home you are also home alone hungry. Once you
 are identified your name will continue to be available each time you play.

 Sound great? Not really there is a 1 in 20 chance the food will kill you,
 or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's life.
